# Exploring and Analyzing the Dataset

In this sub-challenge, you will explore the provided dataset to understand its structure, identify potential issues, and gather insights on handling the data. This is an important step in any data cleaning process, as it allows you to make informed decisions on how to handle missing or duplicate data.

## TODO

1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Display the first few rows of the DataFrame to get an understanding of its structure.
3. Use pandas functions to obtain summary statistics and identify any potential issues with the data, such as missing or duplicate values.
4. Determine the percentage of missing data in each column of the DataFrame.

## Example

You can run the `explore_and_analyze_data.py` file to verify the correctness of the code:

```zsh
# python3 explore_and_analyze_data.py
#transaction_id       0.0
#customer_id          0.0
#product_id           0.0
#product_category     0.0
#transaction_date    20.0
#quantity             0.0
#price                0.0
#rating              20.0
#dtype: float64
```
