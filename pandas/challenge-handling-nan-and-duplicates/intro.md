In this challenge, you will deal with a dataset containing missing (NaN) values and duplicate entries. The main objective is to clean and preprocess the dataset by handling these NaN and duplicate values using pandas library. This challenge will test your ability to work with complex data structures, manipulate and analyze data, and make decisions based on the dataset's characteristics.
